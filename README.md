# Why-Z_Project
## A Frontend Practicing Project

- This Project is still in progress, I'm building it using **HTML**, **CSS**, **SASS**, **Bootstrap-5** and **JavaScript**.

- It's responsive to the different sizes of screens and has two features: 

## 1- The ability to change the website font color (store it at the Local Storage) means it will be the same color "As you Choose" after you close the site

## 2- Moving Keyboard with two languages and all special characters (Built it using HTML, CSS and JS)
